Hi,
I'm Fiona. In January 2021 I embarked on an intense and exciting journey by undertaking a HDip in Computer Science at SETU (Formerly WIT) here in my native Waterford. I had spent many years raising my kids and decided that they were old enough to allow me the time for something new, something just for me. I decided that this was a career change and ultimatly a crazy adventure into computer science and software engineering.

As part of the HDip course I am required to complete a work placement, for which I applied to Red Hat and very excitedly was accepted. From here the adventure continues...
On 1st June 2022 I started a Software Engineering Internship at Red Hat. This blog will document some things that I am learning along the way.
